# LEGO GraphQL

The LEGO website usses a GraphQL API to access data sucs as store locations. This repo is a basic exsample of accessing the LEGO store data. 

Early in the BrickMMO project this store data was acess via PHP and placed in a stores database; however, the GraphQL API recently added some aditional CORS/Cloudflare protocols that has blocked PHPO from access the store data.

This repo is used to test access to the LEGO store data using GraphQL in languages such as PHP and JavaScript.
